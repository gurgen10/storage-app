  "about": "Session Storage is a feature provided by modern web browsers as part of the Web Storage API. It allows developers to store key-value pairs locally within the user's browser for the duration of that browser session. This means that the data stored in sessionStorage persists only as long as the browser window or tab is open. Once the user closes the tab or window, the data is cleared and no longer accessible.",
