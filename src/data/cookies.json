      "title": "Size Limit:",
      "content": "Different web browsers impose limits on the size of individual cookies. As of my last update, most browsers have a limit of around 4096 bytes (4 KB) per cookie. This limit is imposed for security and performance reasons."

      "title": "Domain Limitations:",
      "content": "Cookies are typically scoped to a specific domain. This means that cookies set by one domain cannot be accessed by another domain. Each domain has its own set of cookies, and the limits apply to each domain separately."

      "title": "Performance Impact:",
      "content": "Storing large amounts of data in cookies can impact website performance, as cookies are sent with every HTTP request to the server. Therefore, it's generally recommended to keep the size of cookies as small as possible and to avoid storing large amounts of data in cookies."

      "title": "HTTP Headers:",
      "content": "Cookies are typically set and managed using HTTP headers. The Set-Cookie header is used to create or update cookies, while the Cookie header is used to send cookies from the browser to the server with each HTTP request."

      "content": "While cookies are widely used for legitimate purposes, they can also raise privacy concerns, particularly when used for tracking user behavior across different websites without user consent.

Setting SameSite=Strict means the cookie is only sent in a first-party context. SameSite=Lax allows cookies to be sent in cross-origin requests that are top-level navigations, such as clicking on a link. SameSite=None allows cookies to be sent in all cross-origin requests."
